-- Two fork achievements: "Oracle" (tokens spent on gpt-6-astra) and
-- "Mortal Frame, Rival to Gods" (tokens spent on any DeepSeek model).
--
-- The metric is a TOKEN SUM over the matching models, not a call count, and the tiers
-- ramp by a factor of ten with the top tier at 10 billion tokens:
--
--     bronze 10M   silver 100M   gold 1B   diamond 10B
--
-- The sums come from the usm CTE — (user, source, model, day) usage — so they cover the
-- same history as every other badge. Artwork lives in dashboard/public/achievements/.
--
-- Everything here is idempotent.
